## Why Computer Science?

## How did I stumbled across Computer Science?
My Journey started out in the year 2020 with my obsession in figuring out how the pump attendants (I live in Kenya) were able to carry out fraudulent sales at the fuel pumps in cahoots with the truck drivers of our credit customers. It was a mystery that didn't stay unsolved for too long (Ego much?). *Excel* came to the rescue with an incorporation of a reconciliation method that i came up with (refered to it as the Triangular Reconciliation method) with this implementation we were able to track any fraudulent activity that occured at the Fuel Service Station. Even at this point i did not know that a field of study known as Computer Science existed and taht it dealt with such matters. My Father educated me on it and pointed me in the right direction.(I mostly focused on Excel, it's an amazing tool that you should learn to test your interest in anything Data related, in my case it allowed me to understand how obsessed i was with data)

## My Journey
Fast forward 4 years later...I am currently sitting in my room having requested that my parents offer only food and bed i quit my job and am fully focused on my studies
Before we move forward there is one thing that you should come to terms with as i have and that is "With every one thing you learn today there will be two more that you will need to learn tomorrow" so adopt the learner's mentality,say less listen more (I advocate for its adoption throughout our entire lives.)
So at the the beginning i viewed this path as one that ends at a desk in a well known organization

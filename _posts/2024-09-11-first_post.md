## Why Computer Science?

My Journey started out in the year 2020 with my obsession in figuring out how the pump attendants (I live in Kenya) were able to carry out fraudulent sales at the fuel pumps in cahoots with the truck drivers of our credit customers. It was a mystery that didn't stay unsolved for too long (Ego much?). *Excel* came to the rescue with an incorporation of a reconciliation method that i came up with (refered to it as the Triangular Reconciliation method) with this implementation we were able to track any fraudulent activity that occured at the Fuel Service Station. Even at this point i did not know that a field of study known as Computer Science existed and taht it dealt with such matters. My Father educated me on it and pointed me in the right direction.

## Why Computer Science?

## How did I stumbled across Computer Science?
My Journey started out in the year 2020 with my obsession in figuring out how the pump attendants (I live in Kenya) were able to carry out fraudulent transaction at the fuel pumps in cahoots with the truck drivers of our credit customers. It was a mystery that didn't stay unsolved for too long (Ego much?). *Excel* came to the rescue with an incorporation of a reconciliation method that i came up with (refered to it as the Triangular Reconciliation method) with this implementation we were able to track any fraudulent activity that occured at the Fuel Service Station. Even at this point i did not know that a field of study known as Computer Science existed and taht it dealt with such matters. My Father educated me on it and pointed me in the right direction.(I mostly focused on Excel, it's an amazing tool that you should learn to test your interest in anything Data related, in my case it allowed me to understand how obsessed i was with data)

## My Journey
Fast forward 4 years later...I am currently sitting in my room having requested that my parents offer only food and bed i quit my job and am fully focused on my studies
Before we move forward there is one thing that you should come to terms with as i have and that is "With every one thing you learn today there will be two more that you will need to learn tomorrow" so adopt the learner's mentality,say less listen more (I advocate for its adoption throughout our entire lives.)
So at the the beginning i viewed this path as one that ends at a desk in a well known organization jotting down ideas in a black suit, probably a very expensive one and being able to handle all the political situations that would arise.I had my heart broken and all that changed, quite the existensial crisis it was. So if you are reading this in order to achieve the employemnt goal then i don't think i would be of help to you, but read along if you are enjoying the text.
#### My view/My Path
I no longer the study of Computer science as a tool for making money,advancing my career,being the next great developer rather i view it as a necessity to all that walk this great earth of ours. Let me explain:
As per the lecture "*Awakening from the Meaning Crisis* - John Vervaeke" we learn on  the crirtical impact of language, what language did for us, what language meant to our evoloution as concsious beings, we see that the evolution of language after the collapse of the Bronze age we see the emergence of a psychotechnology *Alphabetic Literacy* invented in Canaan and its development into Hebrew, Such a imple thing yes? Well i should let you know that this simple thing leads us to the awareness of our own cognition (Metacognition). Well and after that we have Fourty Eight episodes educating us on the magnanimous consequences that were caused by what seems to have been an over reaction to such a minor action. 
Well now sit back and ask yourself what will be the reaction of AI? Well let's not go into wether they will take over the world or that we should abandon it before we even get to see its true capabilities. What i want you to do is walk with me on my Journey in my mind as to what path we should strive to follow,
- I have followed this path continuosly:
1) Get lost intentionally (and enjoy it)
2) Follow a structured path that will help you make sense of the scenery you saw while lost
3) Repeat this process (endless loop, well till your soul abandons your body)

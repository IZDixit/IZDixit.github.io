## Why Computer Science?

## How did I stumbled upon Computer Science?
My Journey started out in 2020 with my obsession on trying to figure out how the pump attendants in collaboration with the Truck drivers were able to carry out fraudulent transactions at the fuel pumps. It was a mystery that didn't stay unsolved for too long (Ego much?). **Excel** came to the rescue together with an incorporation of a reconciliation method that i formed (refered to it as the Triangular Reconciliation method) with this implementation we were able to track any fraudulent activities that occured at the Fuel Service Station. Even at this point i did not know that a field of study known as Computer Science existed and that it dealt with such matters till my Father pointed me in the right direction.(I mostly focused on Excel, it's an amazing tool that you should learn to test your interest in anything Data related, in my case it allowed me to understand how obsessed i was with data)

## My Journey
Fast forward 4 years later...I am currently sitting in my room having requested that my parents offer only food and bed i quit my job and am fully focused on my studies.
Before we move forward there is one thing that you should come to terms with as i have and that is "With every one thing you learn today there will be additional two more that you will need to learn tomorrow" so adopt the learner's mentality,say less listen more (I advocate for its adoption throughout our entire lives.)
So at the the beginning i viewed this path as one that ends at a desk in a well known organization jotting down ideas on a notepad in a black suit, probably a very expensive one and quite enjoying having to manuever around the political obstacles at the workplace.Well all that changed as i kept sitting with my thoughts and questioning my purpose in this world and not just looking at what was imporatnt for my career but rather what would take me through life as peacefully as possible. So my view changed......
#### My view/My Path
I no longer look at the study of Computer science as a tool for making money,advancing my career,being the next great developer rather i view it as a necessity for anyone and everyone.Let me explain;
As per the lecture "*Awakening from the Meaning Crisis* - John Vervaeke" we learn on  the crirtical impact of language, what language did for us, what language meant to our evoloution as concsious beings, we see that the evolution of language after the collapse of the Bronze age we see the emergence of a psychotechnology *Alphabetic Literacy* invented in Canaan and its development into Hebrew, Such a simple thing yes? Well i should let you know that this simple thing leads us to the awareness of our own cognition (Metacognition). Well and after that we have Fourty Eight episodes educating us on the magnanimous consequences that were caused by what seems to have been an over reaction to such a minor action. 
Now sit back with this in mind and ask yourself what should we expect with the introduction of AI, well lets look at it from what might happen with the introduction of the different types of AI, as far as i know there are three, two that are just theory and one that we are currently interacting with
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
3. Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI)
Let me let you in the questions that come to the top of my mind in regard to the introduction of each into our lives;
**Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI)**
This is the type of AI that is self aware,the first thing that comes to mind is what is it that we would have figured out for us to have the ability to create a being that is self aware, have we fully understood what consciousness is?, so does that mean that mean consciosness is something tangible something that we can move into another object so can we finally defeat death the inbeatable foe? and what then happens to this AI beings what consequences await them for being concious will they go through the beautiful and horrific situations we went through will they too invent religion and later on kill God, will they have a History a reference to where they are from and where they are headed?
**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
The AI that will respond to our emotions, one that has the ability to read our feelings to make us feel better,something that majority of humans are unable to get a grasp on.
I'm just thinking of one application, one that persistently comes to mind is if we created an AI app or bot that accompanied us through all our decisions be it meetings for signing a contarct or just going out on a date, an AI bot that would guide us and help us avoid getting into messy relationships with for example narcissistic maniacs, well this goes well to an extent that if everyone adopts it we will be able to eradicate all the negative traits that accompany us as human beings, an evolution of the human character, well as every human thing is complicated what happens when those that are incharge in deciding what traits are "acceptable" and which ones are "not acceptable" are ompromoised, what then will happen will they then have the power to dictate what breed of humans come in the 100 years
 














- I have followed this path continuosly:
1) Get lost intentionally (and enjoy it)
2) Follow a structured path that will help you make sense of the scenery you saw while lost
3) Repeat this process (endless loop, well till your soul abandons your body)

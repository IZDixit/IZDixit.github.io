## Why Computer Science?

## How did I stumbled upon Computer Science?
My Journey started out in 2020 with my obsession in trying to figure out how the pump attendants in collaboration with the Truck drivers were able to carry out fraudulent transactions at the fuel pumps. It was a mystery that didn't stay unsolved for too long (Ego much?). **Excel** came to the rescue together with an incorporation of a reconciliation method that i implemented (referred to it as the Triangular Reconciliation method) with this implementation we were able to track any fraudulent activities that ocurred at the Fuel Service Station. Even at this point i did not know that a field of study known as Computer Science, specifically Data Analysis existed and that it dealt with such matters till my Father pointed me in the right direction.(I then mostly focused on Excel, it's an amazing tool that you should learn to test your interest in anything Data related, in my case it allowed me to understand how obsessed i was with data)

## My Journey
Fast forward 4 years later...I am currently sitting in my room having requested that my parents offer only food and bed i quit my job and am fully focused on my studies.(although as 24/09/2024 I sent a Fee Proposal to a Company for a project to Develop an AI-Powered Application for Enhanced Company Operations, fingers crossed)
Before we move forward there is one thing that you should come to terms with as i have and that is "With every one thing you learn today there will be an additional two more that you will need to learn tomorrow" so adopt the learner's mentality,say less listen more (I advocate for its adoption throughout our entire lives.)
At the the beginning i viewed this path as one that ends at a desk in a well known organization jotting down ideas on a notepad in a black suit, probably a very expensive one and quite enjoying having to manuever around the political obstacles at the workplace. Well all that changed as i kept sitting with my thoughts and questioning my purpose in this world and not just looking at what was important for my career but rather what would take me through life as peacefully as possible what would give my life meaning, hence i turned to the Lectures by John Vervaeke. So my view changed......
#### My Path
As for my Computer Science learnings i took on a very specific road map, Select one concrete path and look into multiple other paths, get consfused, get excited, get lost and then get back to your main course with a clearer view as to where you are heading. <br> In my case i enrolled in the <em>FREE!</em> Harvard course and recently i joined the Fast.ai Deep Learning course which is <em>FREE!</em> too. The CS50 courses available on Edx (I bought the "for dummies book" for each language the course took me thorugh, it helped quite a lot), regarding the multiple detours i took,these included looking through YuoTube videos, LinkedIn Learning Courses, Coursera courses and these were not just Computer Science related courses, they invlolved Accounting courses, Management related Courses, Credit Management courses these are all the things i was interested in doing or merging into my Computer Science knowledge.














<!-- - I have followed this path continuously:
1) Get lost intentionally (and enjoy it)
2) Follow a structured path that will help you make sense of the scenery you saw while lost
3) Repeat this process (endless loop, well till your soul abandons your body) -->
